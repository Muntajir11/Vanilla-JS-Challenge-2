# Scoped CSS Variables and JS Project

This project demonstrates the usage of CSS variables along with JavaScript to dynamically update styles in real-time. It allows users to adjust spacing, blur, and base color of an image using range inputs and a color picker.


## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features
- Adjust spacing between elements dynamically.
- Apply blur effect to the image in real-time.
- Change the base color of the image with a color picker.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Muntajir11/Vanilla-JS-Challenge-2.git
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

3. Use the range inputs to adjust spacing and blur, and the color picker to change the base color of the image.

## How it Works

- CSS variables (`--base`, `--spacing`, `--blur`) are defined in the `:root` pseudo-class.
- JavaScript is used to handle user input on range inputs and the color picker.
- The `handleUpdate` function updates the CSS variables dynamically based on user input.
